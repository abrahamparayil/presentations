* Introduction
** Hello :)

*** Ground Rules
- Feel free to interupt me.
  They call it seeking knowledge for a reason.
- No doubts are stupid. People who think otherwise are stupid.

** But does FOSS make sense?
*** Control
   #+begin_quote
If the users don't control the program, the program controls the users. With proprietary software, there is always some entity, the "owner" of the program, that controls the programâ€”and through it, exercises power over its users. A nonfree program is a yoke, an instrument of unjust power.

   --- Richard Mathew Stallman [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html][Free Software Is Even More Important Now (September 2013)]]

** Definition
Free and Open source software is any piece of software that gives it's users the four essential freedoms.
- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).
- Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
** Free Software succeeded because
- Users would rather have software that they were able to fix themselves
- Users would rather use software that they can trust
- Developers now received suggestions and help from skilled users so their work was easier
- With more people looking into the software bugs were found and resolved faster.
** GNU GPL and the birth of Open Source
*** Open Source

- The single document that determines whether a piece of software is free software or not is it's Licence.
- GPL prevented Free Software from being used in proprietary software.
*** Open Source
