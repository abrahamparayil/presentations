* Introduction
** Hello :)
- My name is [[https://abrahamraji.in][Abraham Raji]]
- I'm known online as [[mailto:avronr@tuta.io][avronr]].

  you understand me.
* What is FOSS?
** The Four Freedoms
 Free and Open Source Software is any piece of software that respects their
 user's four freedoms:
 + The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
 + The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
   computing as you wish (freedom 1).
** The Four Freedoms
 + Access to the source code is a precondition for this. The freedom to
   redistribute copies so you can help others

   (freedom 2).
 + The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others
   (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
   benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for
   this.
** Open Source vs Free Software
