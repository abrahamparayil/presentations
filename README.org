#+TITLE: Readme
* Presentations
This are various presentations and their source files. I use Emacs org-mode and
Beamer primarily to generate slides as PDFs. Sometimes I also use Libre Office
Impress.

I prefer to use PDFs for presentations because no other format really compares
to the portability of a PDF and I don't use a lot of transitions or effects and
a normal PDF more or less always takes care of my needs.
